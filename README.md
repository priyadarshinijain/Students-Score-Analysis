#  Students-Score-Analysis
This project analyzes student performance data by gender using Python's data analysis and visualization libraries, including pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. 
The primary goal is to understand how various factors affects student performance in different subjects (Math, Reading, Writing).

# Project Overview
This project includes the following key steps:

Data Loading:
The dataset is loaded using pandas, and basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to understand its structure.

Data Cleaning:
Unnecessary columns are removed, and missing values are handled.

Data Visualization:
Various plots are created to analyze the distribution of students based on gender and their average performance in Math, Reading, and Writing subjects.

Statistical Analysis: The dataset is grouped by gender to calculate and visualize the average scores for each subject.

# Features
